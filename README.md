Implementation of JavaScript in Website

When you scroll, the background of navigation bar will appear and when you scroll to the Top, the background of navigation bar will disappear. I made this using JavaScript. 
In which i used onscroll event, function and use of if else condition statement.
Also added the use of alert() method.
